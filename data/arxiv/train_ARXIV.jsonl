ejected components moving in opposite directions at an angle @xmath12 to the line of sight at an intrinsic velocity @xmath13 , it follows directly from the light travel time difference that the ratio

derive angles near 45 ; the line of sight depth difference between the components in a pair would therefore be an appreciable fraction of their total distance along the connecting line through the core , and roughly equal to the distance projected onto the plane of the sky .", "we derive component speeds that are an appreciable fraction of the speed of light . in combination , the speed and angle solutions imply that the receding component , due to a significant light travel time difference , should be observed at a rather younger age ( 25%-75% ) than its approaching counterpart , and at a correspondingly smaller projected distance from the core", ". however , the observed arm length ratios ( @xmath27 ) are lower by a factor of about 2 compared to the apparent velocity ratios ( 1.33 vs.  2.76 for n2/s2 ; and 1.80 vs.3.50 for n5/s5 ) .", "this requires that currently the light travel time differences between the approaching and receding components are less significant with respect to the ages of the components than our simple speed and angle solutions suggest .", "the arm length ratios depend on the entire history of motion of the components , and the greater degree of symmetry in arm lengths seems to imply that for a significant part of their lifetime the components were slower and/or moving more along the plane of the sky than they are now . a fully self - consistent solution therefore will incorporate a model for the true core location and for this evolution in velocity , since , inevitably , it implies that the receding component is seen at a younger age and therefore with a different velocity than its counterpart .", "this leads to an extension of equations 1 and 2 , into a set where the arm length ratio is directly incorporated ; helical jet models may provide a framework for this extension .", "however , it is beyond the scope of this paper . to properly verify such a model in the case of 1946 + 708 will require observations spanning several decades .", "nevertheless , we believe the velocities we have derived , while not fully self - consistent , are indicative of the fact that the jets of this source contain features that move with speeds that are an appreciable fraction of the speed of light , and certainly much faster than the advance speeds of the hot spots .", "furthermore , the differences in angle ( by at least 15 degrees ) as well as in speed ( by at least 50% ) between the n2/s2 and n5/s5 pairs are good indications of the kinds of changes in component velocity that are evidently occurring in and along the jets .", "both the discrepant arm length ratios and the observed bending in projection of the overall jets on the plane of the sky provide interesting constraints .", "the time evolution of the flux densities of the n2/s2 and n5/s5 pair is shown in fig .", "the n2 component has shown a steady rise by @xmath020% over 13 years of monitoring at 8.4 ghz . during that same time s2", "has only slightly decreased .", "meanwhile both n5 and s5 have been declining though that appears to have leveled off starting in 2006 .", "the amount of the decline was 75% for n5 and 57% for s5 .", "we are currently in the unbalanced situation where s5 appears to be brighter than n5 , which would at first sight seem contrary to the expectations from doppler boosting .", "however , we have to keep in mind that the light from s5 is delayed compared to the light that we see from n5 ( by 27 years for the 2008 epoch according to the geometry derived above ) so that the history of variability must be taken into account when attempting to interpret flux density ratios between component pairs .", "a more detailed analysis of the flux density ratios , taking into account the time variability , should eventually be possible .", "even so , it may not be possible to explain the very significant changes in flux density shown in fig .  7 . given the stability of the component velocities ( see fig .  5 ) .", "local circumstances ( e.g. , variations in magnetic field strength or particle populations ) , and possible interactions of the jet components with their environments , may influence the synchrotron emissivity of the jet components .", "the curvature in the jets of 1946 + 708 ( fig .", "1 ) could be explained by either ( 1 ) ballistic motion from a precessing nucleus ; or ( 2 ) helical

southern hot spot we estimate this apparent motion to be 0.008 @xmath25 0.002 mas / y .", "since the apparent motion measured is relative to the northern hot spot , this is the overall apparent expansion rate of the source , and the apparent motion of the southern hot spot would presumably be half this value , or 0.004 mas / y , corresponding to a projected intrinsic velocity of 0.024 c (

densities ( derived from modelfitting ) , is difficult to explain in terms of doppler boosting given the very low apparent velocities measured for the hot spots .", "a more likely explanation is that the interstellar medium may be enhanced on the northern side , consistent with the observation of greater hi opacity to the north ( peck & taylor 2001 ) . the arm length ratio between northern and southern hot spots is close to parity , 0.94:1 , with the northern hot spot being a little closer to the core . in the case of", "doppler boosting we would expect the northern hot spot to be further away from the core , thus we favor a denser medium on the northern side to be responsible for the difference in flux densities and arm length ratios between the two hot spots .", "the low observed polarization ( less than 0.4% for the core , less than @xmath00.3% for the jet components , and less than 0.1% for the northern hot spot at 8.4 ghz in 1996 ) , can be explained by faraday depolarization due to ionized gas and a magnetic field tangled on scales smaller than the angular resolution of the observations .", "this situation could naturally arise due to magnetic fields and free electrons associated with the accretion disk .", "detection of polarization has only been found in a few csos to date ( gugliucci et al .", "those few incidents of detected polarization occur in the approaching jets of csos which are more asymmetric and core - dominated than typical csos , probably indicating a smaller angle to the line - of - sight , and therefore a more shallow faraday screen .", "after a detailed , multi - frequency , multi - epoch study of the compact symmetric object 1946 + 708 , we find the kinematic age of the extant radio emission to be @xmath04000 years . on

from the jets or hot - spots is detected down to quite low levels ( 0.1 to 0.4% ) , consistent with observations of csos in general .", "future observations over the next decade should allow for a detailed analysis of the newly ejected component pair n6/s6 .", "together with continued observations of n2/s2 and n5/s5 it should be possible to measure accelerations in the jet components , and to tell if each component pair has an intrinsic velocity that is established upon ejection . a more sophisticated analysis , taking into account the flux history of the jet components ,", "could provide
