frequency peakmap and the celestial sphere .", "it is not simple for the non linearity of the mapping ; * to reduce the computational effort , we need to use `` look - up tables '' which introduce further digitization errors ; * to reduce the computational effort , fast algorithms have been developed , which require the use of a rectangular grid to map the sky . compared to the `` optimal '' (

dependent cross section is to generate new partonic hard - scattering functions that are different from the usual spin - independent ones , but that are actually similarly simple in structure .    at the same time , taking the moment of the factorized spin -

the picture gets even worse when it comes to explain quantitatively how these fields generate the plethora of active phenomena observed both at their surface ( e.g.  dark spots ) and in their immediate surrounding ( e.g.  corona , wind ) . particularly interesting in this respect is the case of fully convective stars for which conventional dynamo processes ( supposed to concentrate mostly in the interface layer between the radiative interior and the convective envelope , i.e.  the only place where the field can be stored for a time comparable to the period of the activity cycle ) can not be invoked to justify , not only the presence of a large - scale magnetic field ( e.g.  johns - krull & valenti 1996 ) , but also their very intense activity level .", "the most recent observational results in this field , consisting of temporal series of magnetic maps obtained by indirect tomographic imaging from sets of rotationally modulated spectropolarimetric data ( donati et al .", "1992 ;

moreover , these regions are often observed to form partial , or even complete , rings of azimuthal field encircling the star at various latitudes , and are thus interpreted as the direct detection , at photospheric level , of the quasi - axisymmetric toroidal component of the large - scale dynamo field .", "these results suggest in particular that dynamos operating in very active stars are likely to be significantly different than that of the sun .", "the observations indeed reveal that such dynamos are able to produce large scale field ( and especially toroidal field ) very close to the surface ( since we would not observe toroidal field in the photosphere otherwise ) , and presumably even throughout the whole convective zone ;

statistical filling of multi - hadronic phase space of assumed pre - hadronic clusters ( or fireballs ) formed in high - energy collisions , at a critical value of energy density @xcite . in this

lorentz - invariant quantities which are independent of the cluster s overall momentum .", "secondly , they are quite easy to calculate and provide a very sensitive test of the model yielding an accurate determination of the temperature . however , in order to establish the validity of this approach , it is necessary to test further observables and to assess their consistency with the results obtained for multiplicities .", "certainly , one of the best suited observables is the transverse momentum of identified hadrons , where transverse is meant to be with respect to beam line in high energy hadronic collision , and thrust or event axis in high energy collisions .", "indeed , such projection of particle momentum is supposed to be the most sensitive to hadronisation or , conversely , the least sensitive to perturbative qcd dynamics .", "+ actually , it has been known for a long time that transverse momentum distributions are boltzmann - like in hadronic collisions and this very observation was pointed out by hagedorn as a major indication in favour of his statistical model of hadron production @xcite .", "it must be emphasized that the prediction of a thermal - like shape in principle only applies to particles directly emitted from the hadronising source , whereas measured spectra also include particles produced by decays of heavier hadrons .", "however , most analyses do not take into account the distortion of primordial hadronisation spectrum due the to hadronic decay chain and try to fit the data straight through it .", "this problem has been discussed in literature

of this technique , we have performed an analysis of many measured transverse momentum spectra of identified hadrons in a wide range of centre - of - mass energies for several kind of collisions .", "the statistical hadronisation model @xcite assumes that in high energy collisions , as a consequence of strong interaction dynamics , a set of colourless clusters ( or fireballs ) is formed having certain values of mass , volume , internal quantum numbers and momentum , the latter being inherited from the hard stage of the process .", "those clusters are assumed to give rise to hadrons according to a pure statistical law in the multi - hadronic phase space defined by their mass , volume and quantum numbers .", "this approach differs from another popular cluster hadronisation model @xcite mainly because it gives clusters a volume so that hadron production is ruled by the properly understood phase space rather than relativistic momentum space . in this framework", ", the use of statistical mechanics and thermodynamical quantities , such as temperature , which need spacial dimension besides momentum space in order to be meaningful , is allowed .", "we emphasize once more that the introduction of such quantities does not entail any thermalisation process of hadrons after their formation , nor the existence of a thermalised system event by event . +", "although many clusters with different momenta , volumes , masses and quantum numbers are formed , it can be shown that the average values of many observables , e. g. particle multiplicites , are the same as those relevant

sum of all cluster quantum numbers ) .", "the proof of this statement @xcite , a lengthy one , requires the assumption of special probabilities governing the fluctuations of cluster masses and quantum

order to calculate mean quantities , instead of carrying out an involved microcanonical calculation .", "therefore , even though actual clusters are small sized and microcanonical calculations would be needed to determine mean quantities within each of them , the choice of suitable mass fluctuation probabilities for the clusters allows one to calculate overall means dealing with only one large global structure and with much fewer parameters . arguing the other way around , it is not difficult to be convinced that the fluctuation probabilities to be chosen in order to achieve such reduction

reduction procedure to the microcanonical case which was proved in the canonical case @xcite , where , from the very beginning , clusters were given temperature and volume instead of mass and volume
