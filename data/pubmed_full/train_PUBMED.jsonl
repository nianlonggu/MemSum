this freezes the solution .", "it has been suggested that twisting between the phenolate and imadazolidinone groups of the chromophore is the mechanism for the ultrafast fluorescence quenching internal conversion process .", "neutral form ( a ) of the chromophore , with the phenolic oxygen protonated , can convert to the anionic species ( b ) by going through an intermediate state ( i ) .", "the change from forms a to i is solely a protonation change , while the change from i to b is a conformational change with most changes occurring at thr203 .", "upon excitation of the a state , an excited - state proton transfer ( espt ) occurs in which the proton is transferred from the chromophore to glu222 in a time scale of the order of picoseconds . following radiative relaxation from the excited - state intermediate ( i * ) ,", "the systems returns to the ground state a through the ground - state intermediates i1 and i2.(29 ) excitation of the anionic b state results in direct emission from the excited state ( b * ) at 482 nm . recently", ", a nonfluorescent dark state , state c , has been observed that is distinct from states a and b and absorbs at higher energies.(30 ) the c state , perhaps the neutral trans form of the chromophore , may be populated by nonradiative decay from a * and it may be depopulated by excitation to the excited c * state with transcis isomerization to repopulate state a. fluorescent blinking has been ascribed to nonadiabatic crossing and conversions between the neutral and anionic states,(31 ) or a possible dark ( z ) zwitterionic state . while the ground - state minimum of the gfp chromophore is close to planar , this is not necessarily so for the excited state ; in fact , in some cases the excited state has an energy minimum with a twisted chromophore in which both rings are 90 to each other.(32 ) according to quantum mechanical calculations , the ground and excited states for the  one - bond flip ( obf ) and hula twist ( ht ) in the neutral form ( a ) and the  obf in the zwitterionic form come very close to each other .", "it has been proposed that in the absence of the protein matrix , which surrounds the chromophore and prevents twisting , this process can lead to fluorescence quenching internal crossing;(32 ) see figure 3 .", "recent calculations on the gfp chromophore model compound hbdi suggest that the anionic form of hbdi may also undergo a -obf that leads to a favored radiationless decay channel , which is particularly efficient in solvent.(34 ) ( a ) model compounds of the gfp chromophore in the ground state ( s0 ) can be excited to the first singlet state ( s1 ) in which a ht or obf can freely occur . upon reaching the perpendicularly twisted conformation , fluorescence quenching nac ( nonadiabatic crossing ) occurs .", "( b ) in the ground state ( s0 ) , the residues surrounding the gfp chromophore exert a twisting force on the chromophore (  ) . upon excitation , the conjugation across the ethylenic bridge of the chromophore is reduced and it will twist ;

cycle arrest.20,21 one possible mechanism of cancer preventive effects of garlic in stomach cancer development involves its antimicrobial activities against helicobacter pylori , a major risk factor of stomach cancer.22 hot red chili pepper powder , one of the main ingredient of kimchi , contains capsaicin ( trans-8-methyl - n - vanillyl-6-nonenamide ) .", "although the role of capsaicin in carcinogenic processes has been controversial , there is accumulated evidence that capsaicin is capable to induce apoptosis of cancer cells by generating excess reactive oxygen species.23 thoennissen et al.24 demonstrated that capsaicin caused cell -

induced insulin resistance in both human and rat l6 myotubes , despite elevated tag and dag levels ( 11,13 ) .", "furthermore , a recent study in humans demonstrated that insulin resistant muscle is associated with elevated ceramide content , but no change in dag content ( 30 ) .", "nonetheless , it is also important to note that our measurement of dag assessed total cellular levels of dag , and it is possible that differences in plasma membrane dag were significantly reduced via myriocin treatment . because dag at the membrane is believed to be the specific dag pool responsible for mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance ( 3 ) , it will be important for future studies to investigate this in more detail .", "one of the most surprising findings of this study was that chronic high - fat feeding resulted in a dramatic decline in whole - body oxygen consumption rates .", "the majority of studies that have examined the effect of high - fat feeding on whole - body oxygen consumption rates via use of the clams apparatus have reported elevations in oxygen consumption rates ( 16,17 ) .", "although the differences between these studies and ours could be due to the duration or composition of the diet , we propose two possible explanations for this observation of ours .", "first , it has been reported that obesity - induced insulin resistance causes mitochondrial dysfunction that results from an impairment of fatty acid oxidative capacity ( 58 ) . although it may be possible that our model of insulin resistance is inducing mitochondrial dysfunction , it is highly unlikely due to impairments in muscle fatty acid oxidative capacity , as the rer values in obese mice reported in this study are very close to 0.7 , indicating that these animals have no trouble utilizing fat as an energy source .", "nonetheless , other factors , such as mitochondrial content , protein expression of electron transport chain ( etc ) complexes , or activity of these complexes , may account for potential mitochondrial dysfunction and the subsequent impairment of oxygen consumption rates observed in obese mice ( 31,32 ) .", "however , we did not observe differences in protein expression of cytochrome c of the etc in any group ( data not shown ) .", "second , and just as relevant to the findings of this study , is that obesity - induced insulin resistance has been associated with elevated rates of incomplete fatty acid oxidation , which can arise when rates of fatty acid oxidation are disconnected from tca cycle activity ( 19,33,34 ) .", "this disconnect arises due to the sedentary nature of obese individuals and animals , thus there is no demand for the tca cycle to upregulate its activity to deal with the increased fatty acid supply that is being utilized as an energy source ( 19,33,34 ) .", "if the tca cycle is unable to accommodate the increasing acetyl coa coming from fatty acid oxidation , reducing equivalents such as nadh and fadh2 would not donate their electrons to the complexes of the etc , accounting for the reduction in oxygen consumption rates .", "our observation of increased accumulation of long - chain acyl carnitine esters in the muscle of dio mice is thus consistent with elevated rates of incomplete fatty acid oxidation .", "in contrast , there was an even greater accumulation of long - chain acyl carnitine esters in myriocin - treated dio mice , which at first glance would suggest even greater rates of incomplete fatty acid oxidation in these animals .", "however , myriocin - treated dio mice actually had a significant reduction in the content of a number of short - chain acyl carnitine esters , and this , in combination with the rise of long - chain acyl carnitine esters , is suggestive of long - chain acyl - coa dehydrogenase and subsequent long - chain fatty acid oxidation inhibition ( 35 ) .", "another piece of indirect support for fatty acid oxidation inhibition with myriocin treatment in dio mice is the observation that tag accumulated in the muscle of these animals versus their lean counterparts , but not in control - treated dio mice versus their lean counterparts .", "a reduction in fatty acid oxidation - derived nadh would decrease nadh / nadph oxidase activity and subsequent superoxide production in myriocin - treated dio mice , which would contribute toward their improved mitochondrial function .", "this improvement in mitochondrial function , coupled together with improvements in glucose metabolism and glucose - derived acetyl coa production for the tca cycle , may contribute to the greater oxygen consumption rates in these animals .", "obesity - induced decrements in pgc1 protein expression might also explain impairments in mitochondrial function ( 34,36,37 ) , and although not significant , we observed a trend toward a reduction in gastrocnemius pgc1 protein expression in control - treated dio mice ( p = 0.077 ) that was not evident in myriocin - treated dio mice .", "interestingly , citrulline levels were increased in myriocin - treated dio mice versus their control counterparts ( supplementary fig .", "a previous study in humans showed that supplementation of citrulline enhances aerobic oxidative metabolism ( 38 ) , supporting our findings of increased whole - body oxygen consumption rates and greater exercise time in myriocin - treated dio mice .", "how myriocin and subsequent spt1 inhibition would influence skeletal muscle citrulline levels is currently unknown , but is undoubtedly an intriguing avenue for future investigation .", "in addition , we have previously shown that mcd/ mice ( a genetic model of fatty acid oxidation deficiency ) are protected from obesity - induced insulin resistance .", "interestingly , we show in this study that these exact same animals do not accumulate ceramide in their muscle after 12 weeks of high - fat feeding , leading to the very intriguing possibility that intramyocellular ceramide accumulation is linked to the mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation rates observed in insulin resistance .", "a limitation with our interpretation of whole - body oxygen consumption rates is that , unlike human studies , we were unable to normalize our oxygen consumption rates to lean body mass .", "it is entirely possible that whole - body oxygen consumption rates were simply lower in dio mice because of a significant increase in overall adiposity , due to fat mass having a lower metabolic rate than lean body mass .", "however , the fact that adiposity and body weight were similar between myriocin- and control - treated dio mice suggests that this would not be a contributing factor to the higher oxygen consumption rates observed in the myriocin - treated dio mice .", "although we believe that the changes accounting for the greater oxygen consumption rates in myriocin - treated dio mice primarily reflect the muscle , we can not ignore possible contributions from changes in other peripheral tissues , such as brown adipose tissue and uncoupling protein activity .", "the beneficial effects mediated by inhibition of spt1 and prevention of de novo ceramide synthesis could also arise from liver effects in our animals .", "regardless , we did not observe increases in hepatic ceramide content after diet - induced obesity , and myriocin treatment had no effect on insulin - stimulated akt and gsk3 phosphorylation in obese mice versus their respective controls ( supplementary fig .", ", recent studies have also shown that high - fat feeding does not increase ceramide content in the liver ( 39 ) , and increases in hepatic ceramide content via genetic overexpression of either dgat1 or dgat2 does not result in any type of insulin resistance or inflammation ( 40 ) .", "moreover , we reported no difference during a pyruvate challenge of fasted , obese , control- or myriocin - treated mice ( supplementary fig . 8) , suggesting that gluconeogenic capacity was not different between the two groups and that the liver likely does not play a key role with the improved insulin sensitivity observed in myriocin - treated mice .", "regardless , we can not entirely rule out the possibility that the liver plays a role with the benefit observed during myriocin treatment , as the dio - associated rise in hepatic tag content was reversed via myriocin treatment , and thus it will be important for future studies to delineate the role of hepatic spt1 in greater depth .", "finally , chronic low - grade inflammation has been shown in a number of studies to play a role in causing obesity - induced insulin resistance ( 4143 ) .", "inflammatory and stress kinases , such as p38 mapk and jnk , have been proposed to be downstream mediators of this inflammatory effect , as inhibitors of both kinases are able to prevent high - fat diet  induced insulin resistance ( 9,4446 ) . unexpectedly ,", "the phosphorylation status of both p38 mapk and jnk was not altered by dio , nor was it altered by myriocin treatment ( supplementary fig .", "9 ) , suggesting that inflammation may not play as vital a role in our model of insulin resistance .", "it may also be possible that inflammation in our model is mediated by some other kinase , such as ikk ( 47,48 ) . with regard to the findings in db / db mice ,", "we report very similar findings to what we observed in the obesity - induced insulin - resistant mice , and that treatment with myriocin also yielded a very similar beneficial profile .", "interestingly , gastrocnemius ceramide levels , although reduced in myriocin - treated db / db mice , did not differ between db/+ lean and db / db control mice .", "this suggests , at least in this model , that perhaps ceramide metabolites , such as glucosylceramide , are more important in mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance than ceramide itself ( 49 ) .", "furthermore , the ceramide pool is under a dynamic process of synthesis and degradation ( 9 ) , and although de novo synthesis of ceramide may be increased in these animals , a simultaneous increase in ceramide degradation would mask out any noticeable change . in summary , we show that ceramide accumulation in skeletal muscle plays a key role during obesity - induced insulin resistance , whereas the other lipid metabolites , such as tag , long - chain acyl - coa , and dag , may not be as vital .", "importantly , inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis has novel effects on whole - body energy metabolism and is sufficient to reverse obesity - induced whole - body glucose intolerance and insulin resistance .", "furthermore , whole - body oxygen consumption rates and exercise capacity in obese mice are improved via inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis .", "last , our finding that muscle ceramide levels are not elevated in db / db mice , but that inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis still prevents their development of insulin resistance , suggests the possibility that ceramide metabolites may also play a role in the progression of this disease ."], "summary": ["objectiveit has been proposed that skeletal muscle insulin resistance arises from the accumulation of intramyocellular lipid metabolites that impede insulin signaling , including diacylglycerol and ceramide .", "we determined the role of de novo ceramide synthesis in mediating muscle insulin resistance.research design and methodsmice were subjected to 12 weeks of diet -

up samples ) were included and the same testing algorithm and reagents ( except for detection of anti - dsdna antibodies ) were used for all three patient cohorts .", "as expected , we observed a gradual increase in the prevalence of ana from primary to tertiary care . in our present study ana", "was detected by iif in a screening dilution of 1  :  80 . in several studies", "it has been reported that 1015% of healthy controls are ana positive in this serum dilution [ 1 , 10 , 20 ] .", "obviously , a positive ana test result is not only dependent on the dilution factor but also on the quality of other reagents , that is , fluorescent conjugate , cell substrate , and the fluorescent microscope . for standardization purposes ,", "it has , therefore , been recommended to screen for ana with a specificity of 95% .", "taking this into account , the mere presence of ana in our primary care cohort ( prevalence 6.2% ) lacks discriminating power to identify patients with sard . on the other hand , due to the high negative predictive value of a negative ana result", "furthermore , since both high titre and anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna ( multi-)reactivity may increase the likelihood of identifying a patient with sard [ 11 , 12 , 17 ] , it is apparent in our primary care cohort that 30% of ana positive sera are of medium to high titre ( n = 27 ) , 21% contain anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity ( n = 19 ) , and 37% of the latter reveal multireactivity ( n = 7 ) . in our secondary and tertiary cohorts , the ana prevalence is also relatively low ( 11 and 16% , resp . ) , but in both clinical settings about half of the ana positive sera are of high titre ( 48 - 49% ) . as expected , the observed anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity of ana positive sera in the secondary care ( 39% ) is higher than in the primary care .", "surprisingly , anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity in the tertiary care ( 21% ) is lower than in the secondary care and similar to the primary care .", "this might be related to the spectrum of diseases investigated in the tertiary versus the secondary centres .", "also the higher number of ana requests by tertiary care departments not typically involved in the diagnosis of sard might be the result of academic profiling of the respective departments .", "for instance , the cardiology department of the mumc is specialized in inflammatory cardiomyopathies and a possible autoimmune aetiology of these diseases .", "cardiology requested 108  ana tests ( 9.2% ) , revealing 13% ana positive results of which 20% was anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna antibody positive .", "a second important difference is the presence of a division of clinical immunology within the department of internal medicine of the tertiary care hospital , implying that many patients with sard are evaluated by clinical immunologists instead of rheumatologists .", "the latter difference might at least explain the lower relative prevalence of anti - ena and anti - dsdna antibodies in the rheumatology department of the tertiary care hospital .", "our study shows that in secondary care the majority of positive ana results ( 92.6% ) , as well as the positive anti - ena and anti - dsdna results ( 95.6% ) , are linked to the departments of rheumatology , dermatology , internal medicine , and neurology .", "obviously , patients with the highest pretest probabilities for sard , as associated with the initial clinical presentation , are most likely referred to these clinical departments .", "in clinical settings with lower pretest probabilities , ana positive sera are more likely to be of no clinical significance [ 13 , 18 , 19 ] .", "it might therefore be an option , in particular in primary care settings , to move away from the traditional ana screening test . in this context , the recent discovery of the dense fine speckled ( dfs70 ) antigen is promising and could offer a possible solution for the identification and exclusion of positive sera with no clinical relevance [ 21 , 22 ] . the typical ana dense fine speckled pattern ( dfs ) , known to be associated with the dfs70 antigen , has been found to be commonly prevalent in healthy individuals with ana positive sera ( 33.1% ) , whereas in sard patients 0.0% of the sera revealed a dfs pattern .", "another study revealed that 2 - 3% of sard patients had antibodies directed to the dfs70 antigen . obviously , in sard patients other anti - ena antibodies might be present that hamper correct recognition of the dfs iif pattern", "indeed , the identification and correct interpretation of the dfs pattern might prove to be challenging for diagnostic laboratories and would require additional training .", "moreover , the majority of patterns recognized do not seem to be compatible with a dfs pattern , but this might be the consequence of only interpreting the strongest pattern in the current study .", "since the identification of the dfs pattern might be challenging for routine diagnostic laboratories and inaccurate interpretation can have significant consequences , an immunoadsorption protocol to diminish anti - dfs70 antibody reactivity to hep-2000 cells could be implemented in the current iif assay in order to significantly improve the performance characteristics of the ana iif test [ 21 , 25 ] .", "this approach sustains recognition of sard - related autoantibodies in sera with combined reactivities , that is , anti - dfs70 and other anti - ena antibodies .", "another alternative testing algorithm could , instead of ana iif , include solid phase assays including multiplex and screening assays for well - defined anti - ena and anti - dsdna reactive antibodies [ 11 , 12 , 26 , 27 ] . both approaches enable to distinguish or reduce the number of positive ana results lacking clinical relevance .", "in addition , multiplex anti - ena screening assays are considered to better recognize particular antigens , for example , ssa and jo-1 , as compared to ana iif testing [ 3 , 11 , 12 , 28 ] .", "altogether , the results indicate that in the primary care the usage of traditional ana screening tests is more prone to false - interpretation of positive ana results", ". rather , an alternative testing algorithm for detection of patients with sard might be more appropriate .", "this might either be achieved by immunoadsorption of anti - dfs70 antibodies or direct screening for anti - ena antibodies .", "obviously , a patient with severe clinical manifestations typical for sard presenting in a primary care setting should be referred directly , that is , without any laboratory testing , to the rheumatologist or clinical immunologist .", "this recommendation may not only apply for general practitioners but may also hold for clinical departments that are less likely to encounter patients suspected of sard ."], "summary": ["for the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases ( sard ) , patients are screened for anti -

the positive bovine hydatidosis cases were in the liver and 37.5% in the lung and 12.5% in the spleen .", "the reason why the lung and liver are mostly affected could be due to the fact that the lungs

hydatid cyst density ( 4 cysts per liver ) .", "this was however different from findings by ibrahim   in saudi arabia who observed that the liver had a higher cyst density .", "the difference in the cyst density could mainly be attributed to the higher vascularisation of lung tissue compared to liver .", "the other reason in the difference in cyst density could be as a result of the soft texture of the lung tissue in comparison to liver , which has a harder texture thus restricting hydatid cyst development .", "the number of hydatid cysts that were examined in the lung was 108 while in the liver was 16 .", "most of the dead cysts in the liver were found to be calcified compared to the lung .", ", kebede et al . , and berhe   who reported a higher fertility rate of pulmonary and lower

rate in liver at 38.8% than in the lung at 25.1% and so did dalimi et al .   who reported a higher fertility rate in the liver than in the lung .", "the high percentage of viable cysts indicates that there is a high risk of dog exposure in situations where offal are carelessly disposed of and dogs have access to the infected offal , like the situation is in western province of zambia .", "this points to a possible intervention area in which dogs should be prevented from ingesting infected with cysts such as the lungs and liver . in this study ,", "the annual economic loss as a result of

loss due to ce and other losses such as reduced milk production and reduction in reproduction in cattle .", "the main thrust of the study was to describe the hydatidosis situation in western province so as to increase public health awareness , describe the socioeconomic impact , and to recommend possible mitigation measures .", "it should be noted however , that echinococcosis is a disease of

ms / ms method .", "it is important when comparing alternative analysis platforms to consider the total number of lc - ms / ms runs per proteome , because improved proteome coverage typically can be achieved by lengthening the hplc gradient or by repeating lc - ms / ms analysis of complex samples .", "similarly , many separation modes prior to lc - ms / ms can be at least incrementally improved by simply increasing the number of fractions collected , provided that the resolution of the separation method exceeds the initial fraction size used .", "but in some cases , increases in protein coverage may be too small to be considered advantageous when total analysis time per proteome is considered .", "hence , evaluation of the merits of greater depth of analysis , particularly small improvements , must be constantly weighted relative to overall throughput .", "furthermore , total mass spectrometer instrument time frequently is the limiting resource , and when fractionation prior to the lc - ms / ms step is used , it is the rate - limiting step in proteome analysis throughput . hence , the most meaningful comparisons are those where the total mass spectrometer analysis time per proteome is held constant . in this study , we used a consistent gradient time and 80 lc -

analysis methods .", "our goal was to determine , quantitatively , which method represents the more efficient utilization of mass spectrometer time when analyzing complex proteomes .", "robust proteome analysis methods should be reproducible in addition to identifying the majority of proteins present in a biological sample", ". one major cause of variations in proteins identified in replicate analyses of the same proteome is undersampling in the mass spectrometer , as discussed above .", "therefore , high proteome coverage should be linked to good reproducibility of proteome analysis results because extensive proteome coverage will occur only if undersampling is minimized . a second factor that will contribute to poor reproducibility between proteome protein lists is use of data filtering conditions that result in high false - peptide and protein - identification rates , since false positives usually are random .", "hence , data filtering stringency is another tradeoff that must be considered when selecting a proteome analysis strategy .", "while low stringency filters contribute to noise and low reproducibility , excessively stringent filters will greatly diminish the number of protein identifications and hence the value of the experiment . in the current study", ", data filters were used that yielded peptide false - positive rates between 1 and 2% as estimated using a decoy reverse database , thereby minimizing apparent poor reproducibility between data sets .", "this level of stringency results in very few false positives for proteins identified by two or more peptides and , while there are some false positives within the one - hit protein list , a majority of these identifications are correct .", "the repetitive analyses of 2-d data showed increased peptide and protein counts ( figure 4 ) indicative of undersampling in the basic gelc - ms / ms method used here .", "the overall gain from four repetitive analyses of proteins identified by two or more peptides was 1061 ( 59% ) compared to the initial single analysis . a similar increase ( 61% )", "was observed in repetitive mudpit using nine analyses.(10 ) as expected , the greatest positive impact on proteome coverage was use of a second replicate run , which increased the number of proteins identified by two or more peptides by 33% while doubling instrument time .", "in contrast , adding a third and fourth replicate only increased protein coverage by 13% and 6% , respectively .", "these data indicate that performing a second analysis of each fraction when using gelc - ms / ms would be a positive tradeoff between instrument time and protein coverage .", "however , further doubling of instrument time by performing four repetitive runs is unlikely to represent optimal use of instrument time for most types of experiments . of course", ", an alternative to performing a repetitive analysis of gel fractions would be to obtain more slices per gel lane .", "in analogous experiments where gel lanes were divided into 40 or 60 fractions , we observed increases in the number of proteins identified that were similar to those obtained in this study for duplicate and triplicate analyses of the 20 fractions per gel lane ( data not shown ) .", "although producing more fractions per gel lane increases the number of in - gel digestions , the overall increase in total analysis time for a proteome is minor .", "hence , we generally prefer to use more fractions per lane rather than to replicate analyses when greater depth of analysis is desired using gelc - ms / ms experiments .", "longer gels and larger numbers of fractions per lane were not used in the current study because we wanted to keep total mass spectrometer time per proteome ( approximately 160 h per proteome ) within practical limits while simultaneously matching gel lengths , gel volumes , and other parameters . that is , extrapolating from other 2-d and 3-d experiments that we have performed , we expect that the total number of proteins for each data set ( 2-d , 2-d / repetitive runs , and 3-d )", "would have increased moderately if we would have used 40 or 60 slices per gel lane for all samples . but", "use of 40 or 60 fractions per gel lane would have increased total instrument time to about 320 and 480 h per proteome , which represents an impractically low throughput for most studies .", "interestingly , as we increase the number of fractions per gel lane to 40 or 60 fractions , the incremental increases in new proteins identified diminish , analogous to the diminishing benefits of adding each additional replicate in the repetitive - run approach ( figure 4a ) .", "although similar trends are observed for these two approaches , the mechanisms for increasing protein coverage are quite different . that is , using a larger number of gel fractions increases protein separation and simplifies the mixture of proteins present in each fraction , while repetitive runs exploit subtle variations in peptide separations in replicate hplc runs and subtle variations in data - dependent selection of low - level ions for ms / ms fragmentation and analysis .", "the 3-d method clearly provided superior protein and peptide coverage compared with the 2-d / repetitive method , which indicates that adding an additional protein separation step represents a more efficient use of mass spectrometer instrument time .", "this method identified 3486 proteins with two or more peptides , which is 22% more than the 2-d / repetitive method that used equal instrument time . at the peptide level", ", the 3-d method identified 30  385 high - confidence , nonredundant peptides , which is nearly 2.5 times more than that found in a single survey using the 2-d method ( 12  160 ) and 28% more than the cumulative count in four repetitive analyses ( 23  648 ) .", "furthermore , more unique peptides were found for most low - abundance proteins in the 3-d method data compared with the cumulative 2-d method data ( figure 6 ) .", "it is not surprising that adding solution ief as an additional orthogonal protein separation step to a gelc - ms / ms method is an efficient strategy for increasing proteome coverage and sequence coverage of lower - abundance proteins .", "microsol ief separates the proteins that would normally be in a single gel slice into four gel slices ( see figure 3 ) .", ", the simpler samples should decrease ion suppression effects and reduce dynamic range within each digest . finally , in some cases , improved scores for ms2 spectra in the 3-d method probably resulted from a lower probability of interfering ions being isolated with the target ion for fragmentation .", "while the repetitive analysis strategy also improved proteome coverage , it had neither a built - in mechanism to reduce repeated sampling of abundant ions between replicates , nor could it explore the ions below the ms2 triggering threshold .", "an alterative technique that has sometimes been used to improve replicate runs is to scan different mass ranges in each replicate .", "however , pilot experiments suggested that this approach was less productive than the simple repetitive analysis method used here", ". one frequent criticism of proteomics methods is that the proteins identified on repeat analyses often are not very reproducible .", "a recent study suggested good reproducibility was achievable across 27 laboratories on a simple 20-protein mixture after uniform data processing was used.(35 ) but this simple sample of abundant proteins at the same concentration does not reflect real biological complexity .", "hence , in the current study , we compared the reproducibility between different analysis methods using a very complex sample of biological interest , that is , a human cancer cell lysate . among four replicate analyses of the 2-d samples ,", "this indicated at least 76% of the proteins observed in one analysis were reproducibly detected despite significant undersampling .", "more importantly , at least 90% of the proteins observed in the 2-d / four - replicate data set based on two or more peptides directly matched to a corresponding protein 3-d data set , and most of the apparent mismatches were caused by trivial data analysis issues .", "a more rigorous comparison of the two comprehensive data sets showed that greater than 96% of the proteins identified in the 2-d / repetitive - run proteome were actually observed within the complete 3-d data set .", "one reason for the initially apparent , lower reproducibility when protein names were compared was slight variations in peptides scores together with use of rigid data filter cutoff values ( see above and figure 5 ) .", "that is , the 10% of proteins that were apparently unique to the 2-d / repetitive -
