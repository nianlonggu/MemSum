field sensing and stimulation to provide the shock and post - shock pacing therapy . as a consequence , unlike transvenous systems heating near or around the electrode can not harm the myocardium , which could present with possible safety consequences such as an elevation in pacing thresholds or scarring of the myocardium , but it may still cause serious patient discomfort . because the s -

scanning of these patients without the thermistor probe resulted in no complaints of heating , so it is assumed that the thermistor catheter itself heated during the lumbar scans and caused the discomfort .", "as further evidence , all the heating complaints occurred during rf - intensive scan sequences ( namely fast spin echo ) with the temperature probe located axially near the centre of the bore , where rf fields are the highest .", "the thermistor catheter is constructed of insulated conductive cables connected to electrodes and should couple to the rf fields efficiently , causing heating at the electrodes and pain or damage on the surface of the skin where the probe was placed over the s - icd can .", "if the heating was due to the s - icd can itself , it would more likely occur during gradient - intensive scan sequences ( which can generate eddy currents on can surfaces and internal components ) and at locations in the bore where there are high gradient fields , such as near the bore edges .", "however , when the patient was scanned with gradient - intensive scan sequences ( e.g. flair dwi ) and with the s - icd system in high gradient field locations in the bore ( e.g. such as during a brain scan ) , patients did not detect any heating or discomfort .", "in addition , the subcutaneous lead , which was not instrumented with a thermistor catheter , never resulted in any heating sensation noted by the patient , even when exactly the same sequence that resulted in heating in the first session was used", ". the use of mri - compatible temperature monitors such as fibre optic temperature probes would have provided better confirmation of possible skin temperature elevation and would not have been affected by the rf fields . for cardiac imaging ,", "the main problem to solve is metallic artefact , especially on the gradient - echo sequences . like in research performed by nazarian et al .", ", several scan protocols were used to see if any yielded different effects or reduced the qualitative extent of artefact .", "gradient mode was changed from normal to whisper , resulting in slower ramping of the field and therefore diminishing the changes of the magnetic field in time .", "artefacts when present were limited to blurring of the left ventricle during cardiac scans and most yielded clinically useful information .", "standard interrogation of the s - icd revealed no adverse effects upon the functioning of the system . while no adverse effects upon the post - scan s - icd device function were noted , not all possible scanning protocols were tested .", "it should be noted that , four of the s -

finding of this study is that 20% to 40% of these same individuals respond to the precursors with an unexpected reduction in excretion of the neurotransmitters , particularly dopamine .", "these observations indicate that the simplistic expectation that increased ingestion of neurotransmitter precursors will increase excretion of the mature neurotransmitters in the urine is frequently not observed .", "the uncoupling of neurotransmitter excretion from the ingestion of precursors for the neurotransmitter is most likely caused by the degradation of blood - borne neurotransmitter in the kidney.8,9 most of the serotonin or dopamine found in the urine is synthesized in the kidney.912 therefore , the excreted neurotransmitters must be synthesized in the kidneys and escape reabsorption into the blood in order to be excreted in the urine .", "most of the serotonin formed by the kidneys is typically catabolized2 or reabsorbed and not excreted in the urine.8,11,13 alternatively , dopamine synthesized in the kidney is secreted across the apical surface into the urine14 probably by an organic cation transporter9,15 resulting in greater urinary than interstitial dopamine concentrations.12,13 larger doses of tyrosine and 5-htp have been observed to increase both urinary dopamine and serotonin excretion.1618 the array of catabolic and reabsorptive events probably accounts for the far more complex responses than expected to 5-htp or tyrosine ingestion observed in this study . in spite of the complex sequence of renal events accounting for the appearance of neurotransmitter in urine , the presence of opposing responses ( ie , phases 1 and 3 ) does not seem possible without a direct effect of either the precursors or the formed neurotransmitters to cause an aberration in the series of events leading to the presence of urinary neurotransmitters . based on a large volume of studies in the literature ,", "it is likely that administration of 5-htp increases the synthesis of serotonin within the kidney.2,3,8 transporters for serotonin then transfer it into the blood stream to prevent it from being excreted in the urine .", "the phase 1 response we observed for serotonin could be explained by either a neurotransmitter - induced allosteric alteration of a reabsorptive transporter to increase activity or an induction of the synthesis of the transporter .", "increased transport of the neurotransmitters out of the region of the nephron would theoretically reduce urinary excretion of the neurotransmitter , as observed in phase 1 . if the alteration or induction were great enough , essentially all of the neurotransmitter would be reabsorbed and little or none would appear in the urine , as observed in phase 2 .", "a conversion to phase 3 would be possible if the supply of neurotransmitter eventually increased enough to saturate the transport process and result in spillage of neurotransmitter into the urine .", "all three phases have been observed in the same individual and the three phases could represent different stages of renal processing of 5-htp .", "we currently have no evidence explaining the different phases and the potential for increased activity or induction of neurotransmitter transporters merely appears to be the most likely possibility explaining these observations at this point in time .", "this scenario probably necessitates either an inhibition of dopamine secretion into the nephron lumen or a reduction in renal dopamine synthesis .", "two reports indicate that newly synthesized dopamine is normally secreted into the nephron,12,13 thus an inhibition of this secretion could account for the inhibitory effect .", "it is likely that tyrosine could interfere with the secretion of dopamine into the lumen of the nephron but we are unaware of any reports supporting this site of action .", "tyrosine appears to be an unlikely inhibitor of renal dopamine synthesis because it is widely recognized as a dopamine precursor .", "however , tyrosine suppresses l - dopa uptake into proximal tubule cells14,19 and l - dopa uptake is required for renal dopamine synthesis.20 l - dopa is the immediate precursor to dopamine in the synthetic pathway ; therefore , inhibition of its uptake could impair dopamine synthesis .", "proximal tubule cells accumulate tyrosine14 but the kidney lacks extraneuronal tyrosine hydroxylase1,21,22 and can not convert it to dopamine .", "thus , tyrosine could have a paradoxical inhibition of dopamine synthesis in the kidney by suppressing l - dopa uptake into proximal tubule cells .", "an alternative scenario potentially accounting for phase 3 responses to tyrosine involves the peripheral conversion of tyrosine to l - dopa in neuronal tissue .", "the l - dopa entering the kidney could serve as a precursor to dopamine and result in increased dopamine secretion observed in phase 3 .", "the observation of the inhibitory ( ie , phase 1 ) response to tyrosine has not been reported previously .", "a plethora of reports indicate that phase 3 stimulatory effects of tyrosine on urinary dopamine excretion is the predominant response in most studies in rats4,22,23 and protein has been widely used as a tyrosine source to increase dopamine excretion in humans.24 it is possible that the phase 1 response to tyrosine in humans has not been noted previously because of the limited number of studies specifically investigating tyrosine effects on human dopamine excretion .", "the novel observations noted in this study include a somewhat variable relationship between ingested 5-htp and urinary serotonin excretion and the unexpected influence of tyrosine to reduce urinary dopamine excretion .", "the description of the three phases demonstrating the relationship between 5-htp and urinary serotonin excretion is also novel and probably is a reflection of serotonin reabsorption in the kidney .", "the consistent and statistically discernable ability of tyrosine to dampen fluctuations in urinary dopamine excretion is also noteworthy .", "these processes might be reflective of similar processes occurring in other organs and suggest that urine sampling for neurotransmitters requires multiple samples to determine the direction of the response and , potentially , the adequacy of dosing ."], "sorted_indices": [36, 5, 33, 4, 49, 85, 31,

main objective pursued by the reform in providing additional resources to new model practices was precisely to improve continuity of care , especially among individuals with chronic diseases [ 11 , 12 ] . a possible explanation for this result could be that financial incentives to enrollment of patients with chronic diseases were extended to all phc organizations , thus offsetting the advantage enjoyed up to that point by fmgs .", "another explanation may be increased provision of services by nurses in fmgs and ncs that are not included in our measures of continuity .", "these findings regarding continuity do not support those of an earlier study conducted by tourigny et al . among 1,275 patients followed up in five fmgs .", "that study found an increase in continuity among patients 18 months after their enrollment in fmgs .", ". 's study did not have a control group and was limited to only five fmgs . a second unanticipated result concerns accessibility which showed less unfavorable evolution for patients without chronic diseases in the experimental group than for patients with chronic diseases .", "again , the establishment of new models of phc organizations , and particularly of ncs , was aimed at improving accessibility to care for the general population , but in priority to the neediest individuals .", "it is rather ironic that the ones more in need were more affected by the unfavorable evolution of accessibility .", "another finding that raises concerns is the lack of impact of the reform on unmet needs and use of services .", "conversely , the larger decrease in the percentage of the high users of services at the usual source of primary care in the experimental group can be considered as a positive outcome , possibly associated with more comprehensive and preventive care .", "it could also result from substitution between services provided by physicians and those provided by nurses or other health professionals .", "however , the impact of this outcome remains marginal if not coupled to decrease in er attendance and hospitalization that represent the most costly services .", "our findings regarding accessibility and utilization corroborate studies reporting on fmgs . in an ecological study of the entire quebec population , dunkley - hickin found that a higher degree of physicians ' participation in fgm in a geographical area was not associated with improved accessibility among users of services living in that area . in a large scale cohort study involving 79 fmgs ,", "strumpf observed no improvement in accessibility but a slight reduction in use of primary care and specialist services .", ". followed up a cohort of 122,722 patients enrolled in fmgs compared to 675,102 who were not .", "they found a small reduction in number of emergency visits for those attached to fmgs , but , as in our study , no change in hospitalization .", "none of those studies has reported specifically on patients with chronic diseases compared to those without chronic diseases . in an earlier study conducted on the 2005 sample", "we concluded that the  coordination - integrated model ,  which matched the attributes of the ideal type of fmgs that were to be implemented at that time , emerged as the model with the greatest potential to concomitantly achieve high levels of accessibility and continuity for patients with chronic diseases .", "it could be that the reform had an effect on both phc organizations that have become fmgs or ncs and those that have not changed their status .", "it was not possible with our data to test that spillover effect hypothesis . according to rothman and wagner ,", "the future of primary healthcare largely depends on ability to improve healthcare delivery to meet the needs of chronically ill patients .", "the chronic care model provides six interrelated components for achieving such change among which is delivery system redesign .", "this last condition does not seem to have been met in the implementation of new phc models in quebec .", "a recent report of the auditor general of quebec to the national assembly casts a critical look at the implantation of fmgs and ncs .", "it explains the relative failure of these phc organizations to fully attain the objectives established by the ministry of health and social services by many factors , notably the absence of clear rules , guidelines , and incentives and , above all , the lack of control of the ministry and the regional agencies on the process of implementation .", "this means that several new phc practices received complementary funding without respecting all the components of the contractual engagement .", "howe institute underlines that important factors associated with the slow implementation of fmgs are the low registration rate of patients and the deficient development of teamwork .", "the findings of our study concur with those of other studies and support concerns expressed by analysts .", "the use of difference - in - differences ( dd ) method for isolating the specific effect of the reform is fully justified because it provides good internal validity .", "however , when carried out in a complex system such as the healthcare system , dd analyses can not completely rule out the possibility of spillover effects .", "for example , it is possible that some aspects of the healthcare policies spilled over and influenced phc practices of the unexposed control group or that new phc model practices exerted a mimetic influence on the other practices . surveys lend themselves to possible recall bias by respondents .", "concerning experience of care , unmet needs , and use of services , if present , biases should be equally distributed among respondents .", "recall biases are less likely to occur when reporting events extending over a certain period of time rather than single events taking place at a given point in time .", "responses are always limited by respondents ' subjective understanding and their capacity to report accurately medical information .", "the wording of the questions attenuated this possible effect by referring to validation of the diagnosis by a doctor ( i.e. ,  has a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes ?  ) .", "categories of chronic diseases were defined and operationalized in the same way in both 2005 and 2010 surveys . however , for the category  other chronic diseases ,  it is possible that our redefinition and classification were more inclusive in 2005 , which may explain the higher percentage of respondents reporting this type of morbidity in 2005 . as pointed out in methods , mental illnesses were not excluded but left in all categories of physical chronic conditions , including the no disease category .", "the questions concerning mental health problems were slightly different in 2005 and 2010 as well as the time period reference :  have you ever had   in 2005 and  in the last 2 years , did you see your doctor   in 2010 .", "this may explain the higher percentage of individuals reporting mental health problems in 2005 than in 2010 .", "aside from this difference between the two surveys , mental health problems happened to be evenly distributed among our categories of chronic physical diseases , including the no disease category .", "consequently , we thought that their inclusion would minimize potential biases while increasing statistical power .", "they are subjective but still most appropriate to use in a patient -

size of the patient but it is not always predictable.10 the use of the omentum for various purposes has been reported,8 - 14 because of its peculiar structure , its rich vascular supply that enables its high capacity of absorption , its pronounced angiogenic activity that supports local ( and ischemic ) tissues , its innate immune function , its ability to adhere to local structures and its high concentration of  tissue factors  that promote hemostasia.8,11 - 14 it may promote angiogenic activity in structures adjacent to where it is applied to in animals15 and in human beings.11   the

cells or preadipocytes , which are smaller and able to differentiate.16 adipocytes are now seen as energy storage cells as well as cell with endocrine function.17 the observation that they secrete

of the modulators of the angiogenic process.19 - 21   zhang et al in 1997 , suggested that the vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) is probably the main angiogenic factor produced by the omentum.3 increased vegf expression by hypoxic omentum cells may be responsible for increased omentum angiogenic activity under ischemic conditions through paracrine regulation .", "the trauma of

injection anterior uveitis ( 1.57% bevacizumab vs 1.38% ranibizumab ; p > 0.80 ) or panuveitis ( 0.39% vs 0.41% ; p = 1.0).3 however , randomized prospective trials comparing the rates of uveitis between ranibizumab and bevacizumab are lacking , leading some authors to question whether the complication rates are truly similar.4,7 although underpowered to compare this relatively rare outcome , the 1-year clinical trial results from the comparison of age - related macular degeneration treatment trials reported anterior uveitis in < 1% of study eyes receiving either treatment.8 in retrospect , we believe that the first case was bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis that was originally misdiagnosed .", "amd treatment later resumed uneventfully with ranibizumab and was then switched to bevacizumab for maintenance therapy .", "the anterior uveitis promptly relapsed . to our knowledge , this is the first report in the literature to describe recurrent bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis following a retrial of intravitreal bevacizumab .", "the second patient likely experienced bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis after previously tolerating the medication without difficulty , which has been reported.9 his case is unique in that he was receiving bilateral bevacizumab injections , yet developed only unilateral anterior uveitis .", "both cases corroborate reports from raja et al10 and georgopoulos et al14 describing the safe administration of intravitreal ranibizumab after bevacizumab - related uveitis .", "the etiology of this drug - induced uveitis is speculative at best , since it occurs rarely and there is no histopathologic data with which to correlate the phenomenon .", "the following mechanisms have been proposed : ( 1 ) toxic response to the drug or excipients ; ( 2 ) direct blood - aqueous or blood - retinal barrier compromise by drug or excipients ; ( 3 ) immune response to the drug or excipients ; and ( 4 ) rebound inflammation secondary to vegf suppression.11 the excipients of both preparations are nearly identical : trehalose dihydrate , sodium phosphate , polysorbate 20 , and sterile water ( histidine hydrochloride  in ranibizumab only ) , which makes it more difficult to implicate them in a differential immune response", ". moreover , there are no reported cases of hypersensitivity to any of these excipients in the literature .", "alternatively , this reaction may occur as an immunologic response to the fc protein portion of the full - length antibody molecule itself ; ranibizumab is an fab fragment whereas bevacizumab is a full - length antibody ( fab and fc ) derived from the same parent molecule .", "this is an attractive explanation since other drugs , such as heparin , provoke a differential immune response based on antigenic load .", "unfractionated heparin has a higher propensity to cause heparin - induced - thrombocytopenia than low - molecular weight heparin , presumably due to the larger size of the full heparin molecule and its enhanced ability to form immunogenic complexes with other platelet factors.12 the exact immunologic mechanism underlying these cases of uveitis is difficult to ascertain without histopathologic data , though a delayed - type hypersensitivity reaction seems possible given the several - day lapse in time between exposure to bevacizumab and the onset of uveitis symptoms .", "interestingly , reports in the cancer literature show that infusions of monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab cause immediate hypersensitivity reactions in the majority of cases , though delayed - type reactions can be seen in up to 30% of patients.13 aside from the obvious difference in molecular size between ranibizumab and bevacizumab , it is also possible that differences in drug production could explain the variation in immunogenicity.14 bevacizumab is harvested as a glycosylated product of human ovarian cancer cells , whereas ranibizumab is a non - glycosylated product of bacterial metabolism .", "the glycosylation of bevacizumab creates more potential immunogenic sites compared to the non - glycosylated ranibizumab , which could translate into a higher propensity for bevacizumab to cause inflammatory reactions .", "furthermore , it is interesting to speculate on how the variable dosing regimens for bevacizumab and ranibizumab may contribute to the development of inflammatory complications .", "the predominant anti - vegf dosing schedules used for amd treatment include fixed monthly injections ,  treat and extend , and as - needed ( pro re nata [ prn ] ) injections based on symptoms and oct findings .", "we could not find anything in the literature to suggest that one dosing regimen may result in more complications than another , though it would seem reasonable to postulate that more frequent exposure to a drug could result in a higher likelihood of it causing inflammatory/ immunogenic complications .", "data from the second year of the comparison of age - related macular degeneration treatment trial may help to more fully elucidate the role that anti - vegf dosing schedules play in predisposing patients to inflammatory ocular complications . despite our conjecture regarding the enhanced immunogenic potential of bevacizumab over ranibizumab , a large retrospective study failed to detect a significant difference in the rates of uveitis between the two drugs.3 nevertheless", ", bevacizumab has not been subjected to nearly the same scrutiny ( in the form of rigorous clinical trials ) as ranibizumab , and thus safety data for bevacizumab is relatively lacking.4 the results of future prospective randomized trials comparing the efficacy and side -

benefit analysis that depends on the objectives of each investigation .", "only the sternocleidomastoid and the carotid bulb were used , which represent simple anatomical references that remain virtually unchanged over time .", "the transversal angle view provided a panoramic observation of the cca , thus allowing the observer to identify and measure the thickest imt points , even of the side walls .", "however , measurements taken from the transversal view may result in poor quality images , which are subject to many artifacts that are mainly the result of refraction from the side walls . rather than being a proper measurement angle ,", "previous authors have performed imt measurements from a single longitudinal view,14,2526 which can provide limited observation of the vessel walls , leading to the underestimation of early atherosclerotic processes .", "we avoided directly comparing our findings with these reports due to the methodological differences of each study .", "instead , we used the numbers obtained in our investigation to compare the combined results of imt measured from the two longitudinal views with results from each single longitudinal view .", "as shown in the results , isolated longitudinal views had poorer sensitivity on identifying areas of increased imt .", "the longitudinal views obtained in this investigation provided at least 12 different measurement points ( three from each wall ) , covering the whole extension of the cca in perpendicular angles to generate virtual tri - dimensional information about carotid wall thickness .", "although some authors believe that the near wall images are not accurate enough for imt measurements,2728 we decided to consider these values . in many cases , the near wall presents layers that are far thicker than those in the far wall , which may even have normal values .", "thus , ignoring these findings would underestimate the real state of the carotid artery atherosclerotic process.2930 recent studies revealed a tendency to use the mean maximum thickness of the cca , carotid bulbs , and internal carotid artery ( ica).31 in this investigation , we avoided taking measurements from the carotid bulb or ica for the following reasons : first , even though bulb and ica measurements may be worthwhile , they present limitations : as opposed to cca , they can be measured only in limited angles that may not reflect the thickest portions of vessel wall.3233 also , up to 52% of images can fail to obtain accurate bulb and ica measurements.34 the variance of results of bulb and ica imt amongst repeated examinations and different physicians is higher than cca measurements , making longitudinal comparisons more unreliable.3537 finally , cca , bulb , and ica have morphological differences that make direct imt comparison among them inaccurate.21 yet , cca / bulb / ica measurements do not appear to be superior to cca imt alone.38 we believe that the suggested protocol is an inexpensive method to measure imt .", "we avoided expressing costs in numbers because values may vary from country to country and from private to public healthcare models .", "thus , the eventual cost calculation in our institution may not reflect the reality for many readers .", "although we did not show numbers to confirm our impression , we judged that the presented technique is less expensive because it does not uses complimentary devices and does not depend on external software to analyze the obtained images .", "the acquisition and maintenance of the necessary devices would certainly impact the final costs of examinations .", "the mean time expended in taking all measurements was about 8 minutes . this value is shorter than other models suggested,24 thus representing less of an impact in terms of physician human resources than more complex models .", "the protocol presented is a fast and practical method for obtaining common carotid artery intima - media thickness measurements .", "the combined values of anterolateral and posterolateral longitudinal views provide a more sensitive evaluation of the inner layers of the carotid walls than isolated longitudinal views ."], "sorted_indices": [60, 32, 30, 59, 5, 33, 26, 17, 51, 29, 1, 36, 0, 38, 14, 23, 4, 53, 3, 28, 45, 31, 21, 12, 47, 10, 19, 25, 16, 52, 37, 49, 20, 11, 22, 13, 40, 34, 18, 9, 35, 50, 44, 24, 15, 2, 7, 6, 46, 39, 27, 8, 58, 42, 56, 41, 48, 54, 43, 57, 55]}
