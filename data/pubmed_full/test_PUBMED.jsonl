in the rest of this paper , we consider a single aspect in detail : the potential  problem  of gratitude influencing informed consent .", "empirically , the main reasons given by our participants for donation were : ( 1 ) to avoid the waste of a precious resource , ( 2 ) to give something back to research , and ( 3 ) to compensate for a perceived moral wrong . in none of the three countries", "did our participants indicate that their decision arose out of any sense of gratitude to the physician who had given them ivf treatment .", "this is an important observation , because the possible impact of gratitude on informed consent in embryo donation has previously been raised by bioethical commentators .", "it has been suggested that if there is any institutional or procedural link between ivf treatment and hesc research , the potential donors gratitude toward the clinicians who have helped them to conceive may steer them toward opting for donation ( haimes and luce 2006 ; parry 2006 ; mcleod and baylis 2007 ; also discussed in roberts and throsby 2008 ) .", "the bioethical concern is that parents who receive the  gift of a baby  will feel a sense of gratitude ; feeling grateful might then cause parents to feel that they should respond with a gift in return ; and if a request for donation of surplus embryos is made in that context , potential donors might inadvertently be encouraged to see donation as an appropriate form of return gift . in this way", "the moral emotion of gratitude could compromise the potential donor s freedom to weigh the pros and cons of the request , which in turn means compromising the capacity to give fully voluntary consent .", "even where the clinicians and researchers themselves are scrupulous about not using persuasion , gratitude might be persuading potential donors to do something they would not otherwise choose to do . to avoid this possibility , countries that allow embryo donation for research may attempt a strict separation of ivf treatment and the stem cell research domain .", "( not all legislatures do this , however : china is one country that does not . ) in the united kingdom , for example , it is accepted good practice that requests for donation of spare embryos should not be made by the physician(s ) who delivered the original ivf treatment . in switzerland ,", "a predominant interpretation of the current law on embryo donation is that a couple undergoing ivf treatment should not be told even of the theoretical possibility that a surplus embryo might be generated unless it actually is ( porz et al .", "regulators hope to rule out any conflict of interest on the part of the treating physician as well as the possibility of gratitude on the part of the patient .", "there are several theoretical questions that can be asked about a claim that the  risk  of gratitude affects potential donors decisions .", "for example , moral psychologists might want to examine the emotional exceptionalism in which gratitude is seen as potentially compromising , while other emotions , or even the absence of emotion , is not .", "there is also an obvious empirical question which does not seem to have been closely examined : whether potential embryo donors actually do experience a sense of personal gratitude to the physician  or one strong enough to sway their donation decision .", "however , they do indicate that participants rationales for donation indicate a desire to  give back  in a more complex way .", "first , our empirical results show the importance of distinguishing between the three moral emotions of gratitude , indebtedness , and solidarity .", "what we normally mean by gratitude is an emotion primarily associated with gifts or with help that is undeserved .", "gratitude has been defined as  a feeling of thankful appreciation for favours received  ( guralnik 1971 , 327 ) and is experienced as a positive emotion .", "( 2006 ) provide a basis from experimental psychology for distinguishing between indebtedness and gratitude .", "one important distinction is that  indebtedness is an emotion of exchange , whereas gratitude is not  ( watkins et al .", "even if a debt of gratitude is felt ,  it does not appear to be analogous to an economic debt ", "indebtedness , however , is , literally , a debt : a  state of obligation to repay another  ( mauss 2001 , 2 ) .", "a further feature associated with indebtedness but not with gratitude is the inherent imbalance of power , so that a hierarchy is created in which those who are indebted are rendered more vulnerable . the empirical social psychological work of watkins et al .", "indicates that , in experimental settings at least , a person s feelings of gratitude diminish as the expectation of return ( indebtedness ) increases . the more reciprocity is expected or demanded ,", "importantly for considering the effects of these social emotions on donation decisions , watkins et al . found that the greater the expectation that something will be given back in return , the less motivated the participants were actually to comply with the norm of reciprocity ( watkins et al .", "these results suggest that if patients were to sense any expectation of return by an individual physician or researcher , it would if anything lessen any gratitude they might have felt . in the ivf context , what people have received ( the thing for which they might feel grateful ) is their baby or pregnancy , or at the very least , treatment . donors who achieve this have not received a gift , but a medical service , which will have been paid for in one way or another . in switzerland , where ivf is not covered by the mandatory health insurance", ", this will often be direct payment from the patients to the clinic , as it will also often be in china . in the united kingdom ,", "patients who do not already have children commonly receive two  free  cycles of nhs treatment ( paid for through taxes on the population ) , and then they pay for future cycles directly through fees to the clinics . whatever the system of payment , however , the point is that the ivf physician or clinic has already been paid , directly or indirectly , for the treatment which produced the outcome .", "so in the case of embryo donation , it could be argued that neither gratitude nor indebtedness should be anticipated .", "gratitude would not be expected , because what patients have received was not a favour or unexpected gift ; and indebtedness would not be expected , because there is no debt if payment has already been made . in our three studies , although we found appreciation and high esteem were expressed for the work of the treating hospital or team , we found no evidence of gratitude being expressed toward an individual physician .", "this is despite the fact that in both the united kingdom and china mention was made of the well - known head physicians who led each clinic ; the mentions were in appreciation of their reputations , not as a debt of gratitude .", "participants wanted to do something with the surplus embryo that would be of benefit to research and medical treatment for infertility , but this was not directly associated with the physician who provided it originally . indeed , some of our interviewees were critical of aspects of their own ivf treatment , while still wanting to support the infertility research enterprise overall . in this context , it should be remembered that about half the swiss participants interviewed in fact chose not to donate , primarily out of anxiety about losing control over the fate of their embryos , but also in some cases because it meant researchers were  getting something for nothing .", "study , a few patients were suspicious that research was being prioritised over treatment and that embryos might have been kept back for the research rather than frozen .", "although only a small number of participants expressed this view , it has particular relevance here as it indicates clearly the absence of either gratitude or indebtedness : indeed , it suggests that these participants felt that , if anything , donation would mean the researchers were receiving something beyond their entitlement or were indebted to the patients rather than the reverse .", "social exchanges may entail giving back not to an individual , because the individual may be unknowable or because the benefit may not have come from a single identifiable person , but to  the pattern of social life ", "( becker 1986)for example , giving back to the institutional biomedical research that had helped the participants . in serial reciprocity , person a receives something from person b , but pays back not to person b but to some other third party ( moody 2008 ) . serial reciprocity accounts for the way that altruistic blood donors often do describe their action in terms of reciprocity , even though they have not received anything from the person to whom their blood eventually goes .", "what drives serial reciprocity is not gratitude or indebtedness to an individual or an organisation but a sense of solidarity with unknown others in the community . in the case of embryo donation , what appears to be a directly reciprocal act of gratitude  a surplus embryo in return for treatment  may thus be understood as something quite different .", "participants in our studies used a rationale for donation based not on reciprocal exchange between individuals , but on  giving back to  a research enterprise from which they had benefited and which they hoped would benefit unknown others in the future . for the swiss and chinese donors who choose to donate because they think they are supporting infertility research , these unknown others are not completely anonymous : they are  known  because of imaginatively shared experience .  giving something back  to the research that had helped them ( as they think they are doing )", "was not considered an obligation but , rather , a form of return that was meaningful and seemed especially fitting to them because of the experiences they had gone through . in the u.k .", "study , although there was greater clarity about the purpose of the research being contributed to , there was still a sense among embryo providers that they were benefiting from the fact that others had participated in research in the past which had improved ivf ; they were clear in expressing solidarity with this imagined community of previous ivf research contributors by making their own contributions to research , albeit research in another domain .", "at least some of our participants , then , also see their donation to research as an indirect way of passing on the benefit they have received from research to someone else , whose situation in some way resembles their own .", "the social meaning of this indirect reciprocity is neither gratitude nor indebtedness , but solidarity with other present and future patients .", "to summarise : our interpretation of the material suggests that donors reasons for donating were not connected in any straightforward way to either gratitude or indebtedness . for some people", "the desire not to waste a valuable ( in more than one sense ) resource is foremost .", "a generally positive stance toward biomedical science means that donation is a good use of a valuable resource . with some of the swiss participants", ", we also identified a reparative urge coming from a sense of moral unease , and here donation seems to offer a route through which the urge to make reparation can be satisfied .", "all of this suggests that neither gratitude nor indebtedness per se are present in decision - making at the ivf  stem cell interface , at least not in terms of undue inducement or of compromising the capacity for informed consent .", "the reparative urge foregrounds a different set of ethical questions about the sociomoral meaning of the generation of spare embryos and the act of donation .", "for example , the perceived need for reparation that appears to drive some of the swiss participants donation choices arises because people felt some sense of wrongdoing at creating embryos that are not used for pregnancy .", "the spirit of the swiss legal framework strongly reinforces the sense that the occurrence of embryos not used for pregnancy is to be considered as wrong . from this point of view", ", one possible conclusion could be that the felt desire for reparation is in fact an ethically appropriate response : if the act of deliberately creating an embryo is a morally significant one , which needs to be justified by the good of its intended outcome ( pregnancy ) , then not using it for the purpose that justifies it does indeed present a genuine ethical difficulty .", "on the other hand , the novelty of surplus embryos in the swiss legal and social context ( scully and rehmann - sutter 2006 ) meant that many patients would have been unaware at the time of their ivf of the possibility of generating a surplus embryo .", "moreover , in most cases there were perfectly valid clinical or legal reasons why the embryos could not be transferred , which fully justified the failure to use them as originally intended . that these factors were not in the participants control", "the swiss participants were quite aware of the valid reasons why their embryos could not be transferred , and yet some of them still said that they had fallen short of some moral standard .", "we suggest that this persistent unease ( which does not appear so prevalent in the u.k .", "these are captured in swiss legislation s highly defensive attitude toward embryos in general and the generation of surplus embryos in particular .", "swiss law operates from the presumption that a surplus embryo is an exceptional event that will happen only through the failure of regulation and practice specifically set up to prevent it ( porz et al .", "in addition , as we discussed earlier , the generation of surplus embryos is still an unfamiliar social practice and the role of the embryo donor is one that lacks widespread cultural recognition . in the swiss context of legal exceptionalism , then , producing one of these culturally unfamiliar entities may more readily be understood as something ", "wrong  for which reparation is in order . in the more permissive cultural and legislative context of the united kingdom , although some interviewees expressed guilt about other aspects of the process ( for example , inappropriate styles of speech about embryos ) , there was no sense that not using the embryos as intended in itself constituted a moral failing .", "if our interpretation is correct , as the creation of surplus embryos becomes normalised in swiss society and the role of embryo donor becomes normalised in both the u.k . and", "swiss ( and other ) societies , there will be a shift in ideas about the moral meaning of surplus embryos , and this should be empirically testable . for the majority of the participants in switzerland and the united kingdom who chose to donate their surplus embryos , donation decisions were not driven by a reparative urge but by the feeling that donation expressed solidarity with research and/or other patients .", "what our empirical work shows is that gratitude to an individual must be distinguished from a solidarity - based desire to  give something back  to medical research .", "however , this does not necessarily mean that solidarity -

like ring zone in the paracentral zone of the cornea .", "both photorefractive keratectomy and lasik are subtractive procedures that steepen the cornea by ablating the midperipheral tissue.14,15 this creates an abnormal hyperprolate shape of the cornea that is associated with significant regression , especially in higher degrees of refractive errors.16 it potentially leads to the induction of hoas like coma and spherical aberrations and loss of bcva.17 fili is an innovative technique based on barraquer 's law of thickness,18 whereby the cornea is made steeper by addition of a lenticule of known thickness and power into a pocket created in a patient 's cornea using the fs laser .", "the concept is similar to epikeratophakia , used to treat aphakia in the past , which had its own disadvantages.19 a fs laser overcomes these problems by creating precise lenticules and incisions at an accurate depth . the lenticular tissue processing technique described by mohamed - noriega et al10", "was modified in this study by replacing bovine serum albumin with human tissue culture media to eliminate the risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases or unexpected adverse reactions due to bovine serum .", "the protocols of gradual staged thawing , which are essential for the whole cornea to prevent endothelial cell injury due to sudden thawing , were not strictly followed in this study .", "microbiological and cellular cultures were not deemed necessary , as the tissue processing and preservation were conducted under strict sterile conditions , and the tissue did not contain vital endothelial cells . also , previous studies have suggested that stromal keratocytes within the extracted lenticules remain viable and can be stimulated to proliferate in appropriate cell culture conditions , even after a prolonged period of cryopreservation.9,10 the change in asphericity after fili suggests an increase in the prolateness of the cornea , which is expected after tissue addition , although the observed change was not seen as much as it is after hyperopic lasik.20 the shape of the cornea is more natural after tissue addition compared with tissue subtraction , which does not lead to significant induction of hoas.21 the total hoas after fili remain within normal acceptable values and may be better than hyperopic lasik / photorefractive keratectomy.22,23 also , tissue addition may be more forgiving for mild decentration , which is not the case with hyperopic lasik", ". the rate of enhancement following hyperopic lasik can be up to 10% or more,24 especially in younger patients .", "after tissue addition , significant changes in topography or regression are not expected ; thus , retreatment rates may be lower .", "epithelial thickness profile is more favorable , which , unlike hyperopic lasik , does not cause midperipheral epithelial hyperplasia to compensate for loss of stromal tissue , hence reducing chances of regression.25 problems of haze and flap - related issues like delayed healing , infection , and dislocation are eliminated , thereby leading to greater patient comfort and faster recovery .", "a fairly good refractive predictability was observed with this technique in the treatment of moderate hyperopia , although results were not highly accurate for correcting very high hyperopia ( eg , aphakia ) . in a case study reported by pradhan", "et al,4 a 10 d lenticule was implanted to achieve correction of aphakia but had a high residual refraction of + 5 d. there are possible explanations for this result .", "first , the technique of pradhan et al of pocket creation was different from the technique used in this study . in the said study ,", "a smile lenticule was first created , followed by dissection of the anterior plane to create a pocket , thus making 2 planes that could possibly cause weakening of the cornea .", "second , the optical zone of the lenticule in the study of pradhan et al was 5.7 mm compared with 6 mm in the current aphakia case , causing comparatively less volume of tissue addition .", "the correction is expected to be relatively higher in larger lenticules because there is more volume of the tissue added . in this hyperopic series ,", "the lenticule size ranged from 6.3 to 6.8 mm . also , the posterior curvature changes as described in the case study of pradhan et al reduced the effect on anterior curvature .", "this was also probably the cause of the high + 4.1 d residual refraction in the current study .", "after compensation , implantation of lenticule of approximately 12.5 d is required , and this is currently not possible with visumax .", "the biomechanics of corneas in these patients were not studied due to lack of equipment such as the corvis ( oculus optikgerte gmbh , wetzlar , germany ) . however , because most of the bowman layer is preserved and tissue is being added , it is assumed that the biomechanics are more stable than lasik , where a flap is cut and tissue is subtracted from the periphery.26 the procedure certainly amounts to corneal transplantation and thus , theoretically carries the risk of future rejection .", "however , unlike traditional full thickness grafts , which have a graft  host junction proximal to host limbus , in this technique , the lenticule was well protected in the host corneal pocket and did not come in direct contact with the host 's limbal vasculature and immune system , making the risk of allogeneic graft rejection remotely possible.27 also , the lenticule was mainly stromal collagen tissue ; the incidence of rejection is significantly low in such a scenario compared with endothelial rejection .", "because no sutures are applied , there are no suture - related complications such as loosening , vascularization , or infection that would potentially trigger graft rejection.28 nevertheless , there is a need to monitor for signs of rejection and treat it like allogeneic graft rejection should rejection occur .", "because it is a reversible procedure , the lenticule can always be explanted in the event of any adverse effects or rejection in future .", "the preliminary results of fili in hyperopia indicate that this may be a better technique than hyperopic lasik for moderate hyperopia in terms of stability , regression , aberrations , and postoperative dry eye .", "although it is a bit early to exactly predict the refractive outcomes , initial data indicate that the cryopreservation technique used is safe in heterologous individuals .", "further studies with a larger cohort and modification of the surgical technique with a goal of reducing postoperative astigmatism and refining nomograms are suggested to determine the long -

optimized in a slightly warmer temperature than in the ttc conditions of the current study .", "interestingly , the detrimental effect of hot ambient conditions on speed was not as important as that

a cyclist is related to air density and temperature ( 3,9,17 ) . for example , at an air temperature of 11c , the temperature reported to optimize laboratory cycling capacity ( 14 ) , air density is approximately 1.245 kgm at sea level . in contrast", ", air density drops to approximately 1.165 kgm at a temperature of 30c , reducing the drag force by approximately 6% .", "consequently , the decrease in air density noted in hot ambient conditions is likely to partially attenuate the performance decrement associated with development of hyperthermia during outdoor cycling . in the current study ,", "air density was 9.4% lower during tth-3 ( 1.131 kgm ) than that during ttc ( 1.249 kgm ) , representing a power economy of almost 8% ( 22 ) .", "thus , despite the slightly lower power output in tth-3 than that in ttc ( 3% ) , the average speeds were not significantly different .", "our data showed that mean power output during tth-1 decreased by 16%  5% in unacclimatized cyclists .", "this decrement in power output for an increase in air temperature of approximately 28c between ttc and tth-1 represents an average decrement in performance of 0.5% per 1c increase . even if this decrement is not linear , as the effect of an absolute increase in air temperature is more important in warm than in cold environments ( 13 ) , this rate is comparable with the decrements reported during laboratory tt ( 0.3% to 0.9% per 1c ( 12,23,24,32 ) .", "in addition , the current study quantified the effects of heat stress on performance at different acclimatization stages .", "to date , most studies investigating the effects of heat on performance have examined unacclimatized participants .", "these have shown that artificial heat acclimatization increases the ability to cycle in a hot laboratory ( 18,21 ) and that natural heat acclimatization increases physical performance during sporting activities in hot environments ( 25,26,33 ) .", "however , a comparison of the magnitude of improvement in performance after heat acclimatization , relative to the initial decrement in performance associated with the first exposure to heat stress , has yet to be examined .", "our data showed that the decrement in cycling performance was progressively restored as the cyclists acclimatized . from an average power decrement of 16%  5% on the first day of heat exposure ( tth-1 )", "relative to ttc , the decrement was reduced to 8%  4% after 1 wk of training in the heat ( tth-2 ) and to 3%  4% after 2 wk ( tth-3 ) . despite the cooling effect of air movement", ", our data showed that the average final temperature of the riders was above 40c during tth , irrespective of heat acclimatization ( table 1 ) .", "one rider complained of nausea after tth-1 but did not require medical attention and participated in the following training sessions and tests without any sequelae . despite an average final temperature of 40.2c ( range , 39.6c41.0c ) ,", "this confirms that well - prepared athletes reach high core temperatures while exercising in the heat , asymptomatic of heat illness ( 4 ) , and that there is no absolute critical temperature threshold set at 40c ( 11 ) . in the current study , despite the decrease in power output ( fig .", "1 ) and the possibility to drink ad libitum on the bike , participants lost more than 2% body mass and core temperature reached final values above 40c in the hot conditions ( fig .", "our data showed a decrement in absolute intensity ( i.e. , power output ) during the tt but the likely maintenance of a similar relative intensity .", "indeed , it has been shown that the rise in cardiovascular strain in hot conditions during both constant rate ( 1,36,37 ) and self - paced ( 24 ) exercise mediates a decrease in maximal aerobic capacity , resulting in an increase in relative intensity for a given absolute work rate .", "although power output decreases during prolonged self - paced exercise in the heat , it is proposed that a similar relative intensity to that of cool conditions is maintained and is reflected by a similar or slightly elevated hr ( 24 ) .", "it therefore seems that despite a decrease in power output , hr remained elevated and stable ( fig .", "moreover , the pacing pattern was not dependent on the environmental conditions or the acclimatization level , which is in line with recent reports that pacing strategies are not affected by environmental temperature ( 23 ) , thermal perception ( 2 ) , or the presence of previous muscle fatigue ( 6 ) .", "rather , it seems that pacing during a cycling tt in hot or temperate conditions relates to the maintenance of a physiological threshold or relative intensity ( manifested by hr ) .", "given the progressive reduction in vo2max as hyperthermia develops , sustainable power output is reduced , owing to a reduction in work rate for a given relative exercise intensity ( 24 ) . furthermore , it is remarkable that experienced cyclists started their tt at the same absolute intensity regardless of the environmental conditions or their level of heat acclimatization .", "notwithstanding , it has previously been reported that tt are initiated at the same power output in hot and cool conditions ( 11,24,31 ) .", "this similar work rate adopted seems to correspond to a critical power ( 16 ) .", "given that vo2max does not typically decrease in the first approximately 15 min of exercise in the heat ( 27,29,35 ) , athletes seem to adopt a relative intensity associated with this critical power output . as vo2max progressively decreases with the development of thermal and cardiovascular strain in the heat , the maintenance of a similar relative intensity requires reduction in power output ( 24 ) .", "however , given the role of previous experiences on pacing ( 30 ) , one would expect that the large decrease in power output experienced by the athletes during tth-1 would have led to a conservative start during tth-2 .", "initial power output was similar between trials and decreased thereafter in relation to acclimatization state .", "indeed , early studies suggest that heat acclimatization attenuates the circulatory strain associated with thermoregulation ( 19 ) , allowing normalization of the relation between physiological responses and work intensity ( 10 ) .", "consequently , the cyclists seem to have finished all tt at a similar relative intensity , as suggested by hr and the similar core temperatures recorded upon completion but at a higher power output as acclimatization progressed . of note , the slightly higher hr in tth may be attributable to higher skin blood flow , as suggested by the higher core temperature , although the cyclists were wearing thermal clothing in ttc , which would also have lead to increase in skin temperature and blood flow .", "the current study is the first to investigate cycling performance during outdoor tt in a hot environment .", "however , the

transmissible strains suffer a cost in terms of their replicative ability within humans , then this within - host natural selection acting against vector transmission might be enough to prevent its spread .", "modeling the evolutionary consequences of this in hiv is difficult because each infected human will harbor a suite of genetic variants , some of which will be better at exploiting the human host .", "this will cause evolutionary change in the genetic composition of hiv within the infected individuals . at the same time , this suite of strains is also being transmitted to new hosts via sexual contact and potentially vector transmission .", "the assumption of the above hypothesis is then that the strains that are better able to transmit to new hosts via vector transmission are not the ones best able to compete for resources within a host .", "the simplest way to abstract these processes into a tractable model that still retains the fundamental processes at work is to make an assumption of superinfection .", "specifically , we suppose that humans almost always harbor only a single strain , but occasionally new strains arise by mutation .", "when such a mutation occurs , the mutant then either takes over the host or dies out instantaneously , resulting in a single strain infection once again ( levin and pimentel 1981 ; nowak and may 1994 ) . in keeping with our earlier notation we will use b to denote the vector - transmissible form , and a to denote the form best able to compete within a host and thus to transmit sexually . letting  be the rate at which new mutations arise within an infected host , turning either an a pathogen into a b pathogen or vice versa , and using ij to denote the probability that an i mutant so produced will take over a host originally infected with type j , where i and j are either a or b , model ( 5 ) can be extended to yield ( day and proulx 2004 ; day and gandon 2006 ) with ra and rb again given by equations ( 6 ) . the hypothesis under consideration supposes that within - host competition always favors the sexually transmitted form , and thus we take ab = 0 in equation ( 9 ) . in this case , there are then two possible evolutionary outcomes .", "first , if rb  ra > ba , then the frequency of vector transmission will ultimately evolve to the equilibrium value . on the other hand ,", "in other words , if the significance of within - host evolution is large relative to the benefit of vector transmission , then vector transmission will never evolve .", "this will be true whenever the mutation rate of the virus is high ( i.e. , large  ) and when the selective advantage of sexual transmission in terms of within - host competition is large .", "the first of these is certainly true of most retroviruses , although the second requirement is less well documented . nevertheless , this might provide a selective explanation for why no retrovirus appears to have evolved biological vector transmission .", "experiments and epidemiological data have unequivocally demonstrated , however , that such vector transmission does not occur at any significant level , and various aspects of hiv biology have been implicated as proximate reasons ( bockarie and paru 1996 ) .", "these reasons do not offer an explanation for why vector transmission has not evolved , however , and as weiss ( 2001 ) points out , we ought to seriously consider whether such evolution might occur in the future ( for a summary , see table 1 ) .", "main conclusions of the study existing data suggest that the lack of mechanical vector transmission in hiv is not due to genetic constraints . while ecological constraints , such as number of vectors and biting rates , may limit vector transmission in certain areas , these constraints", "would likely not explain why hiv has not evolved this form of transmission in areas where vector - borne diseases ( e.g. malaria ) are endemic .", "rather , there must presumably be a reason why such transmission is selectively disadvantageous in hiv .", "effective mechanical vector transmission can be brought about only through the evolution of higher levels of viremia , and this also results in a more rapid onset of aids .", "this reduces the duration over which such strains can be transmitted from an infected human , more than is made up for by the occurrence of vector transmission .", "it also remains possible that insufficient time has elapsed for the evolution of vector transmission to occur , but our calculations suggest that this is not a very compelling possibility . on the other hand , existing data is largely consistent with the hypothesis that biological vector transmission has not evolved in hiv because of genetic constraints . at the same time", ", it is not possible to rule out a selective explanation instead . in particular ,", "if there is a genetic trade - off between efficient replication in humans and replication in arthropod vectors , then a conflict between selection favoring effective replication within humans , and selection favoring arthropod transmission between humans can readily prevent biological transmission from evolving .", "this is particularly likely when the mutation rate of the virus is high , and thus might provide an explanation for the lack of biological vector transmission in all retroviruses .", "our analysis might also be extended to include other forms of transmission , for instance needle transmission ( see bruneau et al .", "several evolutionary consequences of this are possible depending both on the level of viremia required for such transmission to occur and the resulting transmission rate .", "for instance , if needle transmission can be achieved with a lower viremia than sexual transmission , and if this leads to a sufficiently high transmission rate , less virulent strains could be favored .", "conversely , if needle transmission requires a high viremia and leads to a sufficiently high transmission rate , more virulent strains would be favored .", "the only situation in which enhanced needle use could lead to the evolution of vector - borne transmission would be if effective needle transmission requires a viremia close to that of vector - borne transmission , while leading to a much higher transmission rate than vector - borne transmission .", "this way , strains with high viremia could be maintained in the population through needle transmission , and vector - borne transmission would then occur largely as a byproduct .", "our conclusions in this article are necessarily speculative , but such speculation is a necessary part of the initial stages of any research .", "one of our aims is to stimulate future research into the evolutionary biology of hiv transmission . from the results presented here ,", "a number of different directions might be taken to ground these evolutionary ideas more firmly in empirical data .", "one possibility would be to examine more closely mechanical vector transmission in immunodeficiency viruses of other species .", "for example , more data on the epidemiological patterns of siv and its potential for alternative routes of transmission would be enormously useful .", "since siv is believed to be at the evolutionary ancestor of hiv , it would be very interesting to know if the longer evolutionary history it has had with its host has resulted in different transmission patterns .", "to the best of our knowledge , there are no empirical studies testing the potential for vector transmission of siv", ". another fruitful approach might be to conduct artificial selection experiments with hiv in arthropod tissue culture .", "experiments have demonstrated that hiv can not currently replicate significantly in arthropod cells , but no study to our knowledge has attempted to select for the evolution of hiv replication in such cells .", "one could even imagine doing such experiments with both mammalian and arthropod cell cultures to determine of the evolutionary trade - off postulated here actually occurs .", "ultimately , it will require innovative experiments and empirical studies to push the boundaries of our knowledge of hiv , and the use of evolutionary biology as a powerful tool for designing sensible intervention strategies .", "these kinds of studies are beginning to appear for other aspects of hiv biology ( e.g. , see mller et al .", "2006 for an interesting evolutionary analysis of hiv virulence ) but more work on transmission biology would be useful .", "for example , if further empirical research validated the hypothesis presented here , that mechanical vector transmission has not evolved because of its associated mortality costs , this would then have important implications for how we attempt to stop the spread of hiv .", "strategies such as condom use , while beneficial for reducing the extent of sexual transmission , could thereby enhance the relative benefit of vector transmission , potentially resulting in the evolution of this new route of transmission .", "the use of antibiotics against bacterial pathogens has clearly brought home the fact that pathogens can readily evolve the means to circumvent our control measures , and there is no reason to expect things to be any different for other control measures .", "the use of antiviral medication , on the other hand , not only reduces sexual transmission but also the level of viremia , and therefore would presumably not move the selective balance more towards vector transmission .", "it is only by asking these kinds of questions , however , that we will have a chance at preventing adverse future outcomes .", "finally , the question of biological vector transmission addressed here is really a special case of the more general question of the evolution of a pathogen s host range .", "why do some pathogens have a relatively broad taxonomic host range while others are much more conservative ?", "this continues to be an interesting and important question in the evolutionary ecology of parasites ( poulin 2007 ) and there are some theoretical results predicting when we might expect different outcomes ( gandon 2004 ) . from the standpoint of human diseases", "this is also clearly an important question since emerging diseases , such as pandemic influenza , are precisely instances in which a pathogen evolves a different host range .", "a better understanding of the evolutionary biology of parasite host ranges is an important goal for future research ."], "summary": ["abstractmany pathogens of humans are blood borne , including hiv , malaria , hepatitis b and c , west nile virus , dengue , and other viral hemorrhagic fevers .", "although several of these pathogens are transmitted by blood -
